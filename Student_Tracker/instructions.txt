1.	@ElementCollection In order to have save list in Hibernate .
	this tag creates another sub-table using super-table's primary key as its own foreign key in which and saves recored for
	each user using same key(<key name> _ <table name>). (tutorial - 10, saving collections, koushik java brains)
	
2.  @AttributeOverride, @AttributeOverrides are to used to override same attribute with different column names.
	it overrides address fields into home_adress and office_address.
	
3.	Hibernate brings PROXY objects from DB while retrieving with only tier 1 data types like int String only.
	in order to GET heavy objects and list, it loads heavy types AFTER we request them for (by Applying Getter())
	in order to save resources and heavy overload.
	else we gotta use @ElementCollection(fetch=fetchtype.EAGER to get entire list and other data
